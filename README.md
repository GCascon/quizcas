###  Refresh favicon the simple way

See [http://www.phpjunkyard.com/tutorials/force-favicon-refresh.php](http://www.phpjunkyard.com/tutorials/force-favicon-refresh.php):

I found a very simple way to update the favicon that works in FireFox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Opera and probably in other browsers too. Just follow these easy steps:

* Start your favorite browser.
* Open the `favicon.ico` file directly, for example http://localhost:3000/favicon.ico
* Refresh the favico.ico URL by pressing F5 or the appropriate browser Refresh (Reload) button
* Close the browser and open your website - voila, your favicon has been updated!
